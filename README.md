## Setting up

There's currently no releases available on the GitHub page, so in order to run it you'll need Node.js installed on your PC and you need to download the repository and move it to a folder.

Open `cmd` prompt on the folder, run `npm install`, followed by `npm run build`.
Copy the electron.js to the newly created `build` folder and run `npm run electron-pack` and you should have the program in the "dist" folder.
